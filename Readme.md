# Readable

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/blakeembrey/readable.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Creates a plain text and readable version of any article on the internet by appending the url to the services domain. Has a extremely simple interface to use and plain CSS for some simple styles.
